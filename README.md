# RNA Sequencing Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains an analysis pipeline for processing and analyzing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. The pipeline is implemented in R and utilizes various R packages including `edgeR`, `DESeq2`, `ggplot2`, and `VennDiagram`.

## Introduction

RNA sequencing is a powerful technique used to quantify gene expression levels in biological samples. This pipeline provides a comprehensive workflow for analyzing RNA-seq data, including differential gene expression analysis and visualization of results.

## Installation

To use the RNA sequencing analysis pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have R installed on your system.
2. Install the required R packages by running the following commands in R:
   
   ```r
   if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
       install.packages("BiocManager")
   
   BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
   install.packages(c("edgeR", "ggplot2", "VennDiagram"))


## Usage

To use the analysis pipeline:

1. Load your RNA-seq count data into R.
2. Follow the provided R scripts (`analysis_script.R`, `plotting_script.R`, etc.) to perform differential gene expression analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and other analyses.
3. Refer to the documentation within each R script for detailed usage instructions and examples.
